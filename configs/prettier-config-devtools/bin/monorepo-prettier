# run prettier inside this repo so we don't have to specify prettier as a dep
# everywhere we specify @mongodb-js/prettier-config/devtools as a dep

# Why npx? The current directory is probably in a different package, probably a
# different monorepo rather than this one. So that's where we're executing
# prettier from. And we can't mess with the current directory, because the
# command-line args assume we're there. But we don't want to have to install
# prettier everywhere so the best we can do is probably to specify prettier once
# per monorepo at the top.

npx prettier "$@"
